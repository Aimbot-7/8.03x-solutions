_Solution sets for problem sets 5, 8,9,10, and 11 will be added soon._

## Directory Structure
Each problem sets's data is placed in its own directory. Alongside the PDF of solution, some of the following files and folders (if not all) are present as well:

- **`main.tex`** - LaTeX file for the problem set solution.
- **`figs`** - Directory containing figures and graphs used in solution.
    - Each figure is named with following naming scheme:
    
      **`fig_<scope>_<problem_number>[fig_number].<extension>`**

      `scope` - The scope of the figure. If figure is part of the problem, scope is `prob` and if it is part of the solution, the scope is `sol`

      `problem_number` - The problem number in which the figure is used e.g. `2.4`

      `fig_number` (optional) - The indexing of figures. If a problem has more than one figures in it, `fig_number` is used to index those figures. `fig_number` could be `a` for first figure in problem, `b` for second and so on.

      `<extension>` - The extension of the figure (pdf, png, etc.)

    - For example, `fig_prob_2.4a.pdf` represents the first figure used in problem 2.4 and `fig_sol_3.1.png` represents the _only_ figure used in solution of problem 3.1.
